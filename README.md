# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then in your browser:

All data → http://127.0.0.1:8080/Dustall.html

Per‑type → http://127.0.0.1:8080/Dustshow.html?place_type=Closed_uncleaned_area

Predictions → http://127.0.0.1:8080/predictions.html

Swagger‑UI → http://127.0.0.1:8080/Pikha/v1/ui
To launch the integration tests, use tox:
